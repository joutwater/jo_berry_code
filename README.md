# Sensing Blue

### Abstract

Human food consumption - A daily necessity and primal, sensory experience. Our sensory systems have evolved greatly over time, allowing us to perceive flavor more effectively than any other organism. Using sensory data from berry cultivation specialists, we will explore the sensory experience of blueberry consumption in an effort to quantify the qualitative components of the process and find patterns in flavor and quality. The goal of this research and berry flavor visualization is to create an analytical and comprehensive flavor data tool that will offer new insights in blueberry sensory analysis, giving consumers a richer perspective of flavor potential in blueberries and, hence, all foods. This project is designed not only for agricultural specialists but audience members of all types. The project will inform the audience of human sensory capabilities, meticulous blueberry breeding processes, and showcase the potential of objective, visual techniques leveraged to communicate what was previously thought to be nearly impossible: subjectivity. Furthermore, this project is meant to promote conscious nourishment through the momentary beauty of food consumption, and remind us to cherish the small moments during our busy, fast-paced lives.
